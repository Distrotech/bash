{"name":"Bash","tagline":"Mirror of git://git.savannah.gnu.org/bash.git","body":"Introduction\r\n============\r\n\r\nThis is GNU Bash, version 4.2.  Bash is the GNU Project's Bourne\r\nAgain SHell, a complete implementation of the POSIX shell spec,\r\nbut also with interactive command line editing, job control on\r\narchitectures that support it, csh-like features such as history\r\nsubstitution and brace expansion, and a slew of other features. \r\nFor more information on the features of Bash that are new to this\r\ntype of shell, see the file `doc/bashref.texi'.  There is also a\r\nlarge Unix-style man page.  The man page is the definitive description\r\nof the shell's features. \r\n\r\nSee the file POSIX for a discussion of how the Bash defaults differ\r\nfrom the POSIX spec and a description of the Bash `posix mode'.\r\n\r\nThere are some user-visible incompatibilities between this version\r\nof Bash and previous widely-distributed versions, bash-4.0 and\r\nbash-4.1.  For details, see the file COMPAT.  The NEWS file tersely\r\nlists features that are new in this release. \r\n\r\nBash is free software, distributed under the terms of the [GNU] General\r\nPublic License as published by the Free Software Foundation,\r\nversion 3 of the License (or any later version).  For more information,\r\nsee the file COPYING. \r\n\r\nA number of frequently-asked questions are answered in the file\r\n`doc/FAQ'.\r\n\r\nTo compile Bash, type `./configure', then `make'.  Bash auto-configures\r\nthe build process, so no further intervention should be necessary.  Bash\r\nbuilds with `gcc' by default if it is available.  If you want to use `cc'\r\ninstead, type\r\n\r\n\tCC=cc ./configure\r\n\r\nif you are using a Bourne-style shell.  If you are not, the following\r\nmay work:\r\n\r\n\tenv CC=cc ./configure\r\n\r\nRead the file INSTALL in this directory for more information about how\r\nto customize and control the build process.  The file NOTES contains\r\nplatform-specific installation and configuration information.\r\n\r\nIf you are a csh user and wish to convert your csh aliases to Bash\r\naliases, you may wish to use the script `examples/misc/alias-conv.sh'\r\nas a starting point.  The script `examples/misc/cshtobash' is a\r\nmore ambitious script that attempts to do a more complete job.\r\n\r\nReporting Bugs\r\n==============\r\n\r\nBug reports for bash should be sent to:\r\n\r\n\tbug-bash@gnu.org\r\n\r\nusing the `bashbug' program that is built and installed at the same\r\ntime as bash.\r\n\r\nThe discussion list `bug-bash@gnu.org' often contains information\r\nabout new ports of Bash, or discussions of new features or behavior\r\nchanges that people would like.  This mailing list is also available\r\nas a usenet newsgroup: gnu.bash.bug. \r\n\r\nWhen you send a bug report, please use the `bashbug' program that is\r\nbuilt at the same time as bash.  If bash fails to build, try building\r\nbashbug directly with `make bashbug'.  If you cannot build `bashbug',\r\nplease send mail to bug-bash@gnu.org with the following information:\r\n\r\n\t* the version number and release status of Bash (e.g., 2.05a-release)\r\n\t* the machine and OS that it is running on (you may run\r\n\t  `bashversion -l' from the bash build directory for this information)\r\n\t* a list of the compilation flags or the contents of `config.h', if\r\n\t  appropriate\r\n\t* a description of the bug\r\n\t* a recipe for recreating the bug reliably\r\n\t* a fix for the bug if you have one!\r\n\r\nThe `bashbug' program includes much of this automatically.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to contact the Bash maintainers directly, send mail\r\nto bash-maintainers@gnu.org.\r\n\r\nWhile the Bash maintainers do not promise to fix all bugs, we would\r\nlike this shell to be the best that we can make it.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nChet Ramey\r\nchet.ramey@case.edu\r\n\r\nCopying and distribution of this file, with or without modification,\r\nare permitted in any medium without royalty provided the copyright\r\nnotice and this notice are preserved.
