<p>This is GNU Bash, version 4.2.  Bash is the GNU Project's Bourne
Again SHell, a complete implementation of the POSIX shell spec,
but also with interactive command line editing, job control on
architectures that support it, csh-like features such as history
substitution and brace expansion, and a slew of other features. 
For more information on the features of Bash that are new to this
type of shell, see the file `doc/bashref.texi'.  There is also a
large Unix-style man page.  The man page is the definitive description
of the shell's features. </p>

<p>See the file POSIX for a discussion of how the Bash defaults differ
from the POSIX spec and a description of the Bash `posix mode'.</p>

<p>There are some user-visible incompatibilities between this version
of Bash and previous widely-distributed versions, bash-4.0 and
bash-4.1.  For details, see the file COMPAT.  The NEWS file tersely
lists features that are new in this release. </p>

<p>Bash is free software, distributed under the terms of the [GNU] General
Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation,
version 3 of the License (or any later version).  For more information,
see the file COPYING. </p>

<p>A number of frequently-asked questions are answered in the file
`doc/FAQ'.</p>

<p>To compile Bash, type <code>./configure', then</code>make'.  Bash auto-configures
the build process, so no further intervention should be necessary.  Bash
builds with <code>gcc' by default if it is available.  If you want to use</code>cc'
instead, type</p>

<pre><code>CC=cc ./configure
</code></pre>

<p>if you are using a Bourne-style shell.  If you are not, the following
may work:</p>

<pre><code>env CC=cc ./configure
</code></pre>

<p>Read the file INSTALL in this directory for more information about how
to customize and control the build process.  The file NOTES contains
platform-specific installation and configuration information.</p>

<p>If you are a csh user and wish to convert your csh aliases to Bash
aliases, you may wish to use the script <code>examples/misc/alias-conv.sh'
as a starting point.  The script</code>examples/misc/cshtobash' is a
more ambitious script that attempts to do a more complete job.</p>

<a name="reporting-bugs" class="anchor" href="#reporting-bugs"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Reporting Bugs</h1>

<p>Bug reports for bash should be sent to:</p>

<pre><code>bug-bash@gnu.org
</code></pre>

<p>using the `bashbug' program that is built and installed at the same
time as bash.</p>

<p>The discussion list `<a href="mailto:bug-bash@gnu.org">bug-bash@gnu.org</a>' often contains information
about new ports of Bash, or discussions of new features or behavior
changes that people would like.  This mailing list is also available
as a usenet newsgroup: gnu.bash.bug. </p>

<p>When you send a bug report, please use the <code>bashbug' program that is
built at the same time as bash.  If bash fails to build, try building
bashbug directly with</code>make bashbug'.  If you cannot build `bashbug',
please send mail to <a href="mailto:bug-bash@gnu.org">bug-bash@gnu.org</a> with the following information:</p>

<pre><code>* the version number and release status of Bash (e.g., 2.05a-release)
* the machine and OS that it is running on (you may run
  `bashversion -l' from the bash build directory for this information)
* a list of the compilation flags or the contents of `config.h', if
  appropriate
* a description of the bug
* a recipe for recreating the bug reliably
* a fix for the bug if you have one!
</code></pre>

<p>The `bashbug' program includes much of this automatically.</p>

<p>If you would like to contact the Bash maintainers directly, send mail
to <a href="mailto:bash-maintainers@gnu.org">bash-maintainers@gnu.org</a>.</p>

<p>While the Bash maintainers do not promise to fix all bugs, we would
like this shell to be the best that we can make it.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
